# Hello, I'm Mehmet

I describe myself as a **lifelong learner** and **passionate IT professional**, which means I am not afraid to take on new challenges and try my hand at different technologies and projects of varying scales. My focus is primarily on **data-related projects**, helping businesses to improve their Business Intelligence and Software Infrastructures through **CI/CD pipelines**, **Cloud environments**, and **Data pipelines**. I am passionate about using **open source tools** to solve problems and do not limit myself to any one technology, instead opting for the best tool to solve a given problem.

I am always eager to tackle challenges that push me outside of my comfort zone.
